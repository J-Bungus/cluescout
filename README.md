# ClueScout
ClueScout is a Python program that can be used to scrape the clues and answers to the daily crosswords from the New York Times. 

It will generate a JSON file to store the data and pretty print the data to a text file. It will also generate a URL page to keep track of the last-scraped puzzle.

Through a command-line interface (CLI), the user can query the database for information regarding the puzzle for a particular day or search for specific clues or answers.

## Features
- Display the crossword for a specific date, which includes the across clues, the down clues and their associated answers
- Display all the associated answers for an exact clue as well as answers that partially match the entered clue
- Display all the clues associated with a particular answer
- Each entry will also have its matching date to the crossword that it is from
